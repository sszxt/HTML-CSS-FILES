    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Max Emilian Verstappen was born on 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium
      to Jos Verstappen and Sophie Kumpen. Verstappen's parents separated when
      he was young, after which he lived with his father. His younger sister,
      Victoria, lived with their mother. Verstappen has three younger
      half-siblings from his father: a sister from Jos's second marriage and a
      brother and sister from Jos's current marriage
      <br /><br />
      His family has a long association with motor sports: his father is a Dutch
      former Formula One driver, his Belgian mother competed in karting,and his
      first cousin once removed, Anthony Kumpen, competed in endurance racing
      and is a two-time NASCAR Whelen Euro Series champion currently serving as
      the team manager for PK Carsport in Euro Series. Although Verstappen has a
      Belgian mother, was born in Belgium and resided in Bree, Belgium, he
      decided to compete with a Dutch racing licence. He stated he "feels more
      Dutch", having spent more time with his father than with his mother during
      his upbringing, and was always surrounded by Dutch people while growing up
      in Maaseik, a Belgian town at the Dutch border. [13] Verstappen said in
      2015: "I actually only lived in Belgium to sleep, but during the day I
      went to the Netherlands and had my friends there too. I was raised as a
      Dutch person and that's how I feel."[14] In 2022, however, Verstappen
      stated that he appreciates both sides and is "half-half at the end of the
      day".[15]
      <br /><br />
      He competed in Formula One for more than a season before obtaining a road
      driving licence on his 18th birthday.[16] Verstappen moved to Monaco the
      day after, in October 2015, and has lived there since and has said it was
      not for tax reasons.[17] In November 2020, Verstappen bought a Dassault
      Falcon 900EX aircraft from Virgin Galactic. The aircraft is registered
      PH-DTF and operated by Exxaero.[18]
      <br /><br />
      In his free time, Verstappen enjoys sim racing. Having taken part in many
      sim racing competitions, Verstappen stated that it helps him with his real
      life racing keeping him "ready to go". [19] Verstappen is a member of Team
      Redline; a multinational sim racing team.[20] Verstappen is a supporter of
      FC Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven. [21] Verstappen speaks three languages,
      Dutch, English and German, the latter of which he learned while karting
      with Michael Schumacher.[22] In September 2022, he was made an Officer of
      the Order of Orange-Nassau in recognition of his racing achievements.[23]
      Verstappen has been dating Kelly Piquet publicly since January 2021.[24]
